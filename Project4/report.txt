Project Experiments

1. Compare the achievable throughput, loss, and CPU utilization in Linux and Windows platforms.
2. Compare the achievable throughput versus the number of client sessions, under both TCP and UDP.
3. Compare the request mode performance under persistent versus non-persistent HTTP mode.
4. Compare the performance of TCP Cubic and TCP BBR under lossy networks (e.g., random packet loss rate > 0). Use tc to emulate the packet loss.
5. Please describe how the server makes sure to close all the sockets and indicate the specific line(s) of code responsible for this.
6. Please describe how you control the pool size and indicate the specific line(s) of code responsible for this.
7. Do you disable Nagle algorithm? And indicate the specific line(s) of code responsible for this.
