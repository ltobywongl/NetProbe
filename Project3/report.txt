Project Experiments

1. Compare the achievable throughput, loss, and CPU utilization in Linux and Windows platforms.

With pktrate set to 0 and protocol set to UDP, the measurings are as follow. (Server send to client)
Linux Platform:
Throughput: 154.12 Mbps
Loss: 1.89%
%CPU 47.5

Windows Platform

2. Compare the achievable throughput versus the number of client sessions, under both TCP and UDP.

With pktrate set to 0 and protocol set to UDP, the measurings are as follow. (Client send to server)
Linux Platform:
1 session running:  231.02 Mbps
2 sessions running: Average 165.25 Mbps per session
3 sessions running: Average 118.84 Mbps per session

The achievable throughput drops for each client. But the total throughput of all the clients sum up is increasing with session number.

3. Explore the performance impact of delay and loss using Linux tc to emulate different delay and loss scenarios.

Add delay of 1000ms: tc qdisc add dev lo root netem delay 1000ms
With pktrate set to 0 and protocol set to UDP, the measurings are as follow. (Server send to client)

The throughput dropped to 7.23 Mbps. In Q1, it was 154.12 Mbps, that is a significant drop.
The loss is now 95.67%.
